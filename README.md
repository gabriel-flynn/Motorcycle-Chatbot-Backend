# Track-Locator
An API built in Golang to find the closest motorcycle track in the USA to a user using the Bing Maps API. 

- Pretty bare bones API built with the intended usecase of being consumed in a chatbot that is knowledgeable about motorcyles.
    - This API will help provide the ability for the chatbot to tell the user it is interacting with where the nearest motorcycle track they can go ride at is based off whatever locstion information they provide to the chatbot (pretty much anything that theBing Maps can interpret - address, city, state, landmarks, etc.)
